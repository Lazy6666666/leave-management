## How to Use These Stories

Each user story follows the standard format:
- **As a** [user role]
- **I want to** [perform some action]
- **So that** [I can achieve some goal]

Acceptance criteria are specific, testable statements that define when a story is complete.

## Role-Based Access Control

Stories are organized by user role:
- **Employee**: Can submit leave requests, view history, manage documents
- **Manager**: Can view team calendar, review requests, manage team coverage
- **HR**: Can manage users, configure policies, generate reports
- **Admin**: Full system access, user management, system configuration

## Integration with Development

These stories will be used to:
- Define feature requirements for development
- Create test cases and acceptance criteria
- Guide UI/UX design decisions
- Estimate development effort
- Track progress during implementation

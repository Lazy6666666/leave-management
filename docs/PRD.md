-- Policies
CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON employees
  FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = supabase_id);

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own profile" ON employees
  FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = supabase_id);

CREATE POLICY "Managers can view team members" ON employees
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM employees m 
      WHERE m.supabase_id = auth.uid() 
      AND m.role IN ('manager', 'admin', 'hr')
      AND (m.department = employees.department OR m.role IN ('admin', 'hr'))
    )
  );

CREATE POLICY "Admin/HR can view all employees" ON employees
  FOR SELECT USING (
    EXISTS (
      SELECT 1 FROM employees e 
      WHERE e.supabase_id = auth.uid()

  FOR SELECT USING (requester_id = (SELECT id FROM employees WHERE supabase_id = auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "Users can insert own leaves" ON leaves
  FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (requester_id = (SELECT id FROM employees WHERE supabase_id = auth.uid()));

CREATE POLICY "Users can update own leaves" ON leaves
  FOR UPDATE USING (requester_id = (SELECT id FROM employees WHERE supabase_id = auth.uid()));

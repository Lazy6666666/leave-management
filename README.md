# Leave Management System

This repository contains the source code for the Leave Management System, a web application designed to streamline the process of requesting and managing employee leave.

## Overview

The system is built with a modern technology stack, featuring a Next.js frontend and a Supabase backend. It is intended for internal use initially, with a focus on scalability for potential external deployment.

### Key Features

*   **Employee Self-Service**: Employees can submit, view, and manage their leave requests.
*   **Manager Dashboard**: Managers can review and approve or deny leave requests from their team members.
*   **Leave Balance Tracking**: The system automatically tracks and displays remaining leave balances for each employee.
*   **Scalable Architecture**: Built with a serverless backend (Supabase) and a flexible frontend (Next.js) to support future growth.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized into the following main directories:

*   `frontend/`: Contains the Next.js application that serves as the user interface.
*   `backend/`: Intended for future backend services, currently configured for Supabase.
*   `docs/`: Contains project documentation, including the Product Requirements Document (`PRD.md`).
*   `scripts/`: Holds utility scripts for development and deployment.
